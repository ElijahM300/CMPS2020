The base case I had before which checked to see if start >= end was wrong for this program since when
my program was checking if there were any triples, it went outside of the array bounds when the start value was 
set to the second to last element in the array. This base case wouldn't be able to make sure that the program 
didn't go out of bounds of the array when checking for triples before it finished, so to fix this I replaced my base 
case with when start + 1 == end since there's only two elements left in the array at that point and there wouldn't be 
able to be anymore triples in the array.

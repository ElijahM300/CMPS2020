1. The merge sort algorithm was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

2. An advantage the merge sort algorithm seems to have over other sort alogorithms is that instead of trying to
sort the data all at once in like bubble sort or selection sort, it instead divides the data in half, sorts those pieces of data,
and then merges the data back together.

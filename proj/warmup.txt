1. int foo(int arr[], int s, int e){
       if((e + 1) < 1)
           return -1;
       if((e + 1) == 1)
           return (arr[s]*2);
       else
           return (arr[s] + arr[e]);     
   }


2. if(n) would be the base case since it checks to see if n is null which, if it is, the program stops 
running and returns. It tells the program under which condition it should stop so that there isn't an infinite loop,
this is what makes it a base case.
